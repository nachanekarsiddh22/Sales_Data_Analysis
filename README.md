**Introduction** 

            The project "Sales Data Analysis of E-Commerce Sites Using Python" aims to get valuable insights from sales data from leading e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra. I had 373,701 rows of unclean data from different cities across the United States. I identified and addressed inconsistencies in the data, including null rows, null cells, repeated titles and incorrect data formats. I removed all data quality issues and then analyzed the data. 


**Objective of the Study**

           Objective of the Study The primary objective of this project is to analyze sales data from e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra. By examining sales data, we aim to address the following questions: 
• Which month is best for selling products? 
• Which city orders the highest number of products? 
• What time of the day do people order the most goods online? 
• Which product has the highest demand and why? 
• How does the demand for products change over time? 
• What is the correlation between product price and quantity sold?
