**Introduction**
            The project "Sales Data Analysis of E-Commerce Sites Using Python" aims to get valuable insights from sales data from leading e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra. I had 373,701 rows of unclean data from different cities across the United States. I identified and addressed inconsistencies in the data, including null rows, null cells, repeated titles and incorrect data formats. I removed all data quality issues and then analyzed the data.
